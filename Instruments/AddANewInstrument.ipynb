    "## LLM\n",
    "Back in prehistoric times (pre-2022) to automate transforming documentation into code we'd have to write a custom parser to break down the document to write the code. However, unlike the scpi protocol, there is no requirements for how a company writes their documentation. Therefore consturcting a parser to be universal would take a long time and require a rigourous design. So instead we will use an LLM. As we do not want to pay for api access, sadly I could not seemlessly integrate it into this notebook so you, dear user, will have to use your own chat window. Assuming you are in VS Code, I would recommend using the built in Github Copilot feature and you will not have to leave the ide and can easily switch between which LLm you are querying. It is a bit slower than using a web browser, but automatically has the context of the already written code.\n",
